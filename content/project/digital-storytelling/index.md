This is a project based learning (PBL) inspired course that utilizes a PBL assessment guide in addition to thoughtful integrated learning. Throughout the course, experimentation and the practice of storytelling through the lenses of multiple mediums allows students to develop narrative reasoning skills while 
simultaneously giving them a realm to be creative and challenged. The course was created in response to the demand from entertainment industries for individuals skilled in content creation and transfer of thinking. 

The purpose of this course is to get our students to become creators rather than just consumers. The course focuses on content creation, specifically in the realms of: visual, auditory, videographic, and interactive storytelling. The course also focuses on digital literacy, and how to become a responsible denizen. At any point throughout the course, students use information and communication technologies to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information, requiring both cognitive and technical skills.
