The Interactive Digital Media Capstone course brings together the core courses in Media Design and Production with the concepts of User Interface Design (UID), User Experience Design (UX), and creative coding to develop team based projects. This course emulates the industry production process and synthesizes media and digital storytelling from other production courses into emergent media projects.  

Capstone Projects are teacher facilitated, student led teams creating a digital media artifact from conception to presentation. Example works might include a 2D or 3D video game, a student-developed social network web application, a movie or animation, interactive informational kiosk for a museum or library, or a concert of student-created digital media performances.
