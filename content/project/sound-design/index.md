Sound Design has students learning the fundamentals of music: what goes into writing, performing, recording, editing, and analyzing multiple styles of composition. After a crash course in the fundamentals of music theory: scales, chords, notation, etc. students begin learning how to work with audio in Industry-leading audio workstations as they write and record their own tracks.

In the Sound Design course students are exposed to a wide variety of music styles and production techniques. They begin by learning the fundamentals of music theory to serve as a baseboard for a variety of other topics. Following this, students learn how to arrange, process, and write music using Industry-leading Digital Audio Workstations such as Studio One and Pro Tools. This includes editing and compiling different recordings as well as generating their own music from scratch with software synthesizers. Students are also exposed to a variety of recording techniques and practices in order to take their own track from conception, to written music, to the recording studio, and finally to be mixed and mastered for listening.
